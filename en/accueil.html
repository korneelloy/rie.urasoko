  <div> My research focuses on the phonological and morphological aspects of languages, and more specifically in the case of Japanese, 
    which is a language generally categorized as a pitch accent language.
    My research focusses on accentual/tonal phenomena/changes, the existence (static phenomenon) of inaccented words, 
    the phenomenon of deaccentuation (dynamic phenomenon) and the link between default accent and atonicity. 
    My thesis investigates the true status, origin and nature of atonic words in modern Tōkyō Japanese
    through the phenomenon of deaccentuation. In the final part of my thesis, I 
    also proposed an analysis within a formal framework (autosegmental phonology) to better capture
    the mechanism and meaning of the phenomenon of desaccentuation from a broader perspective.
    My thesis also tackled a fundamental question in accent phonology, that of 
    the existence of atonal words in a pitch-accent language. The strong presence of atonic words
    poses a delicate theoretical question in terms of typology. 
    What is the origin, function and principle of the accent? 
    What is the definition of a pitch-accented language? 
    Is Japanese really an accent language? <br><br>
    My thesis opens up multiple perspectives. 
    In the future, I plan to carry out a field survey and an experimental phonetic study, in order to verify the legitimacy of 
    the results obtained. 
    Objectively quantifying the weight of different morpho-phonological parameters influencing deaccentuation will also be one of 
    my future research objectives. I'm also interested in comparing Japanese with other pitch-accent languages (
    Korean dialects (gyeongsang, kyungsang), Nubi (Sudanese), Biscayan Basque) that allow and/or forbid inaccented words. 
    The questions I raise are: how do we describe, categorize and analyze accentual/tonal change in a language? 
    Is accentual development part of a universal logic of prosodic simplification/reduction? 
    What role do other factors (phonetic, morphological, semantic or syntactic) play in accentual/tonal change? 
    What are the causal relationships? <br><br>
    I'm also interested in the pedagogical aspect of the Japanese language, 
    as it's essential to understand prosodic characteristics when learning a modern language. 
    The Japanese language has rich dialectal varieties representing distinct accent systems. 
    The observations arising from a comparison between the different accentual systems of Japanese, 
    carried out as part of my thesis, will contribute to a better understanding and therefore transmission of the complexity 
    of the accentual system of this language. It is also essential to emphasise that Japanese is not limited to a single accentual system.
