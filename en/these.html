        The Ph.D. thesis "The Atonic Pattern and the Deaccentuation Phenomenon in Contemporary Japanese" deals with a subject that raises 
        some fundamental questions in the field of accentual Phonology in (contemporary Tōkyō) Japanese, 
        as well as in the broader framework of phonological theory. 
        It concerns the existence of atonic (or unaccented) words and of the deaccentuation phenomenon, 
        the latter referring to an accentual pattern shift from tonic to atonic. 
        These two typologically rare phenomena also call for broader theoretical inquiries. 
        The aim of this research is to examine the morphophonological factors that favor or hinder deaccentuation. 
        The methodology involves studying the shared characteristics of nouns that have undergone deaccentuation between two editions of 
        a pronunciation and accent dictionary (1998 and 2016, NHK edition). 
        Five key parameters have been considered: word length, original position of the accent kernel, moraic structure, morphological 
        structure and frequency. One of the most important findings concerns the first two parameters. 
        Based on our data study, it is claimed that in regard to the sensitivity and resistance to deaccentuation, 
        Japanese nouns can be divided into three sizes (small, medium and large). 
        In addition, accentual patterns can be categorized into two natures (strong and weak). 
        The significance of this classification should be understood in the light of the influence of these factors on the 
        deaccentuation process, independently of a factor which is known to have an important influence on deaccentuation in Japanese, 
        namely the lexical stratum. Indeed, the three lexical strata (native, sino-Japanese and western loanwords) have very different 
        morphophonological characteristics, but word size and strong accent patterns play a similar role when it comes to deaccentuation 
        regardless of the stratum. The thesis also proposes a tonal analysis of deaccentuation within the framework of autosegmental 
        phonology (Goldsmith 1976). The hypothesis is based on the assumption that Japanese deaccentuation is closely related to two 
        (horizontal and vertical) concomitant tonal assimilations. 
        These two natural and basic phenomena are frequently observed in tonal languages (Hyman 1975; Hyman & Schuh 1974). 
        This purely tonal approach not only provides a simple and elegant understanding of the deaccentuation mechanism, 
        but also aligns with the main results of our study. 
        These findings indicate an important sensitivity to deaccentuation amongst medium sized-words (3µ and 4µ) and weak accent patterns 
        (final and penultimate), as well as a notable resistance to deaccentuation in smaller (1µ and 2µ) and larger (5µ or more) sized-words 
        and strong accent patterns (antepenultimate and initial).
